00:00.200 --> 00:05.020
Do this video we'll learn about virtual machines hosts and hypervisor.

00:05.550 --> 00:12.390
And in order to truly understand what a virtual machine is we're actually going to start by thinking

00:12.390 --> 00:15.830
about a physical machine a physical server.

00:15.960 --> 00:24.810
So when we purchase a physical server it comes with memory CPQ it comes with Network Interface Cards

00:25.380 --> 00:31.860
and adapters to connect to the disk capacity of that physical server so also comes with all that hardware

00:31.860 --> 00:32.370
built in.

00:32.370 --> 00:38.970
And then we install some operating system right in this case let's assume it's windows and then we can

00:38.970 --> 00:40.410
run applications.

00:40.410 --> 00:45.900
And what happens in the physical server is all of these applications run inside of our operating system

00:46.530 --> 00:50.410
and the operating system kind of owns that hardware.

00:50.550 --> 00:57.450
And so as applications are utilizing the hardware the operating system can control them can control

00:57.450 --> 01:05.470
how much resources they have access to and it sort of handles the intermediation between the applications

01:05.920 --> 01:06.730
and the hardware.

01:06.740 --> 01:09.230
Self.

01:09.330 --> 01:12.830
Now let's think about a virtual machine.

01:14.130 --> 01:22.260
And instead of having a physical server here let's replace it with a host and instead of installing

01:22.260 --> 01:27.800
a simple operating system on this host let's install a hypervisor instead.

01:27.870 --> 01:32.770
And now we're not going to run applications on this physical system.

01:32.820 --> 01:40.350
We're actually going to run virtual machines each with their own independent operating system.

01:40.380 --> 01:44.860
Some of these V-Amp could be windows virtual machines some could be Linux.

01:44.880 --> 01:46.730
It really doesn't matter.

01:46.820 --> 01:51.740
And in this case the virtual machines are still running on the same physical system.

01:51.780 --> 01:59.550
It will still buy a server the same way we always have and it will have memory and CPQ and physical

01:59.550 --> 02:07.940
network interface cards and possibly storage adapters possibly local storage and then we're going to

02:07.940 --> 02:12.600
install a hypervisor on it instead of installing Windows or Linux.

02:12.630 --> 02:23.640
I'll install ESX II or Hyper-V or some other hypervisor and the hypervisor acts as the intermediary.

02:23.640 --> 02:29.720
It interposes itself between the virtual machines and the hardware.

02:29.720 --> 02:33.550
This is the magic sauce that makes virtualization work.

02:33.560 --> 02:38.190
Now all of my Reems can share a common set of physical hardware.

02:38.420 --> 02:44.630
I can have a bunch of virtual machines each with their own independent operating system sharing a common

02:44.630 --> 02:51.420
set of memory CPQ common physical network interface cards and storage adapters as well.

02:53.030 --> 02:59.010
And so as my first virtual machine goes to access hardware it's utilizing the memory of the host.

02:59.180 --> 03:01.220
It's utilizing the C.P. of the host.

03:01.340 --> 03:04.550
It's utilizing all of the physical resources of the host.

03:04.970 --> 03:10.580
But what's happening is the hypervisor is actually the thing that's in control of those physical resources

03:11.150 --> 03:18.740
the hypervisor has direct access to the physical hardware and it's controlling which virtual machines

03:18.740 --> 03:23.830
get access to how much memory how much physical Sipa access do they get.

03:24.440 --> 03:27.920
And how do they access their network and storage adapters.

03:27.920 --> 03:35.120
And as more virtual machines are created on this hypervisor They're also sharing that exact same set

03:35.180 --> 03:37.490
of physical resources.

03:37.550 --> 03:43.490
So that's what the hypervisor controls as how are those resources shared how were those resources presented

03:43.790 --> 03:45.840
to the individual virtual machines.
