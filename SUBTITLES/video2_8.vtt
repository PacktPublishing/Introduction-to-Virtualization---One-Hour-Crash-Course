00:00.940 --> 00:08.200
In this video we'll take a look at a couple of the key benefits of virtualization starting with consolidation

00:08.410 --> 00:09.480
and efficiency.

00:10.300 --> 00:11.420
So let's think about it.

00:11.420 --> 00:19.720
Jim let's compare our virtual infrastructure to a gym and some of you may have experienced this before

00:19.720 --> 00:26.680
if you're a gym goer around January 1st the gym starts to get really busy.

00:26.680 --> 00:27.440
Right.

00:27.760 --> 00:38.190
So during the normal part of the year a gym with maybe 20 treadmills and 50 exercise machines may suffice.

00:38.410 --> 00:43.780
But if you're a gym owner you know that come January there's going to be two to three times as many

00:43.780 --> 00:49.970
people and it would be awesome if you could triple the size of your environment.

00:51.070 --> 00:57.010
Temporarily and then when all those people realize that yeah maybe we don't really like exercising so

00:57.010 --> 00:57.980
much.

00:58.510 --> 01:00.790
Then they start to stop coming.

01:00.790 --> 01:02.890
You could maybe get back down to size.

01:02.950 --> 01:03.560
Right.

01:04.060 --> 01:06.940
And that would be really awesome if we could do that with the gym.

01:06.940 --> 01:15.080
It would also be really great if we could do that with the hardware of our virtual data center.

01:15.510 --> 01:22.740
And when we start talking about virtualization it kind of leads us to this idea of eventually cloud

01:22.740 --> 01:31.440
computing right where there is a vendor or a service provider like Amazon Web Services for example that

01:31.440 --> 01:39.330
we can maybe spin up a bunch of temporary virtual machines on somebody else's hardware and accommodate

01:39.540 --> 01:42.240
that busy time of the year for us.

01:42.240 --> 01:50.790
But we can't really get there without virtualizing first and we're coming out with a one hour cloud

01:50.790 --> 01:53.940
course as well a crash course in cloud.

01:53.940 --> 01:59.410
But we really need to get virtualize first because you can't move to the cloud and you virtualize it.

01:59.430 --> 02:06.980
This is the first step along that path to where we can get to what we call a state of Alaska city where

02:06.990 --> 02:12.710
we can rapidly grow and rapidly shrink the resources at our disposal.

02:13.050 --> 02:19.410
Can't really do that with virtualization but virtualization is a building block towards that sort of

02:19.410 --> 02:20.700
flexibility.

02:21.360 --> 02:27.310
But well virtualization provides us with is the ability to consolidate workloads.

02:27.810 --> 02:35.400
Here we see a whole bunch of physical servers in a data center and hopefully every single one of these

02:35.670 --> 02:40.930
servers isn't running only one operating system instance.

02:40.990 --> 02:48.070
Think about how many more workloads we could accomplish if we were running 20 to 30 windows instances

02:48.610 --> 02:53.960
on every single one of these servers instead of just one per server.

02:53.980 --> 02:56.840
That's the biggest benefit of virtualization.

02:57.010 --> 03:03.640
And that's the benefit that initially drove this innovation to virtualize consolidation

03:06.200 --> 03:10.640
The other big benefit is efficiency.

03:10.640 --> 03:15.960
So here we see a few different servers that maybe we have on physical systems in our environment.

03:16.010 --> 03:21.410
Maybe we have a print server that's using like 20 percent of its CPO and 20 percent of its memory and

03:21.410 --> 03:24.690
a web server and a database server and who knows what else.

03:24.710 --> 03:28.930
These are physical servers that really are using all of their resources.

03:29.860 --> 03:33.660
And if you think about it you paid for all that hardware.

03:33.790 --> 03:38.970
If you're only using 20 percent you're wasting 80 percent.

03:39.010 --> 03:48.190
So by stranding resources on a physical host that can only run one operating system we really have two

03:48.190 --> 03:50.360
choices of how we can handle that.

03:50.410 --> 03:57.700
We could start installing other applications on our print server and making multiple applications run

03:57.700 --> 03:58.810
on the same server.

03:59.050 --> 04:05.320
But as we kind of start doing that that opens up a whole different can of worms because now if I need

04:05.320 --> 04:10.420
to reboot this print server I have to really start thinking what else is running on this print server

04:10.900 --> 04:15.420
and what else am I going to impact by doing maintenance on my print server.

04:15.580 --> 04:20.520
And so I start creating all of these interdependencies on the same hardware.

04:20.650 --> 04:22.110
And that's not a good thing.

04:24.600 --> 04:30.330
So most of the time what we end up with is just resource waste.

04:30.330 --> 04:36.870
If we instead were to get rid of those physical servers consolidate those workloads on a hypervisor

04:38.410 --> 04:47.050
and run multiple operating system instances on that hypervisor now we can really start to oversubscribed

04:47.620 --> 04:54.520
and we could start to right size and we can shoot for that sweet spot where we wanna be like 60 70 percent

04:54.520 --> 04:56.290
resource utilization.

04:56.290 --> 05:02.860
So we're using the resources that we've purchased but we're not overburdening them.

05:02.980 --> 05:10.150
That's our goal with virtualization is to maximize the investment in hardware that we make without wasting

05:10.150 --> 05:13.300
money on resources that we're never going to utilize.
