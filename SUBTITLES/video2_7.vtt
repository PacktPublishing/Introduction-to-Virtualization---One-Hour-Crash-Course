00:01.680 --> 00:06.240
In this video we're going to learn about our fourth and final food group storage.

00:06.270 --> 00:12.870
So we've already learned about C-p memory and network and the fourth food group that my VM needs is

00:12.870 --> 00:22.380
storage and we want to bear in mind as we're working our way through these four food groups that this

00:22.380 --> 00:28.540
guest operating system has no idea that it's running within a virtual machine.

00:28.920 --> 00:38.620
This VM has no dedicated physical hardware and that includes a desk or the virtual machine doesn't have

00:38.680 --> 00:42.020
a physical disk that's dedicated to it.

00:45.460 --> 00:50.700
So much like we saw with networking with networking.

00:50.710 --> 00:55.250
We had a virtual Mac with storage virtualization.

00:55.250 --> 00:58.420
We're going to have a virtual scuzzy controller.

00:59.090 --> 01:06.390
And if we think about the way that a physical server works with internal hard drives when the operating

01:06.390 --> 01:13.140
system needs to write some sort of data to disk the operating system generates a scuzzy command if it

01:13.140 --> 01:20.550
needs to read data from disk it generates a scuzzy command and it sends that command to the scuzzy controller

01:20.880 --> 01:25.640
which interfaces with those physical disks.

01:25.670 --> 01:28.240
That's the way that Windows is used to working.

01:28.280 --> 01:33.850
And guess what Windows doesn't know that it's running within a virtual machine here.

01:33.920 --> 01:35.960
So we need to maintain that illusion.

01:37.600 --> 01:42.910
So what we're going to do is provide windows with a virtual scuzzy controller.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.330
We're going to make it feel just like it used to feel when the virtual machine was connected to local

01:49.360 --> 01:51.050
physical disks.

01:51.670 --> 01:58.900
So when Windows needs to carry out some sort of storage command it's going to think I've got a scuzzy

01:58.900 --> 02:03.400
controller let me send that storage command to the scuzzy controller.

02:03.400 --> 02:11.540
And what happens after the fact is the virtual scuzzy controller is actually a virtual The vice.

02:11.780 --> 02:17.660
So essentially what you're doing is you're taking those storage commands and you're giving them to the

02:17.660 --> 02:23.670
hypervisor the virtual machine is sending those storage commands through its virtual scuzzy controller

02:24.300 --> 02:27.430
and they are arriving at the hypervisor.

02:27.650 --> 02:33.720
And now the hypervisor determines what happens to those storage commands from here.

02:34.010 --> 02:41.600
If this virtual machine has its VMT K or virtual disk file on a local disk it will simply send those

02:41.600 --> 02:50.740
storage commands that file on a local disk or maybe we're using a storage array it could be a fiber

02:50.740 --> 02:51.940
channel storage array.

02:52.000 --> 02:58.510
It could be an ethernet based I scuzzy storage array that could be fiber channel over either that it

02:58.510 --> 02:59.720
really doesn't matter.

02:59.860 --> 03:01.530
They all sort of work the same way.

03:01.540 --> 03:04.960
What's really different is the network.

03:05.150 --> 03:10.320
So maybe the hypervisor will send that storage command to let's say it's a fiber channel.

03:10.430 --> 03:17.870
HBO is my storage connection and that storage command will traverse that fiber channel network till

03:17.880 --> 03:20.580
it eventually arrives at the virtual desk.

03:20.690 --> 03:24.950
And you can see I've named some of the files here for that virtual machine.

03:24.950 --> 03:31.550
I've named them according to what they would be named in VM Ware but the concepts remain the same regardless

03:31.550 --> 03:36.860
of the hypervisor your virtual machine is going to have a virtual disk.

03:37.010 --> 03:43.160
And so that's how the scuzzy commands get from your virtual machine to your virtual machines virtual

03:43.220 --> 03:47.600
disk regardless of where that virtual disk is located.

03:47.600 --> 03:54.050
So let's watch our scuzzy command as the Windows virtual machine generates a scuzzy command.

03:54.290 --> 03:57.130
It sends it to the virtual scuzzy controller.

03:57.230 --> 04:04.660
The hypervisor determines the appropriate location for that virtual desk sends it out the storage adapter

04:04.910 --> 04:11.850
and the storage command arrives at the data store and the changes are actually written to the file that

04:11.850 --> 04:16.790
contains the virtual machines virtual desk.

04:17.330 --> 04:22.380
Now one other important concept that I want to talk about here.

04:24.310 --> 04:30.640
One of the big benefits of virtualization is mobility and and we'll get to that as we get further into

04:30.640 --> 04:31.750
this course.

04:31.780 --> 04:33.970
What I mean by mobility.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.340
But just think about a scenario here where we have down here at the bottom.

04:39.340 --> 04:41.910
We'll call this a fiber channel storage array.

04:42.520 --> 04:48.270
And maybe I've just invested in a new I scuzzy storage array.

04:48.490 --> 04:53.590
And please excuse the crudity of my little diagram here.

04:53.620 --> 04:59.440
But I want to use it to illustrate a point I made up here I've got a nice cozy storage array down to

04:59.440 --> 05:01.660
the bottom I've got a Fiber Channel Sorge right.

05:01.990 --> 05:09.250
And maybe I want to take this virtual machine and all of its files and relocate those files to my scuzzy

05:09.490 --> 05:17.500
storage device which is on a different network ethernet network while I can do that right.

05:17.510 --> 05:23.380
And the reason I can do that is because of my hypervisor layer.

05:23.580 --> 05:31.270
So as the scuzzy commands come out of my virtual machine they are received by the hypervisor.

05:31.320 --> 05:36.470
It's it's going to then take those storage commands and do whatever it needs to do with them.

05:36.840 --> 05:44.070
Right so if I've got some other storage adapter here connecting to I scuzzy and I relocate this VMS

05:44.100 --> 05:51.220
files to that other storage array the hypervisor is aware that I've made that change.

05:52.160 --> 05:57.940
And it simply redirects those storage commands to the new location and you can even do this without

05:58.030 --> 05:59.950
any downtime on your virtual machine

06:02.610 --> 06:06.420
so storage virtualization gives us some pretty awesome capabilities.

06:06.420 --> 06:12.240
One other capability that I want to mention want to throw one more scenario out here.

06:12.240 --> 06:21.420
Let's say that we have multiple ESX I host and I now choose to take this Windows VM and relocate the

06:21.420 --> 06:24.290
live state of the VM to another host.

06:26.410 --> 06:32.890
Well that's going to work out just fine too as long as this other host has the ability to connect to

06:32.890 --> 06:39.950
the shared storage my virtual machine will still be able to access its virtual disk and all of the other

06:39.950 --> 06:42.370
critical VM files that it needs.

06:42.830 --> 06:50.880
So this is how storage virtualization and shared storage help us to achieve mobility.

06:50.900 --> 06:56.960
We can take virtual machines move them to different hosts we can move their files from one storage system

06:56.960 --> 07:04.800
to another without any downtime and it's all due to the fact that we have this hypervisor in the middle

07:05.220 --> 07:09.480
interposing itself between the virtual machine and the hardware.

07:09.480 --> 07:18.510
This is where we really start to see what people called decoupling the decoupling aspect means the virtual

07:18.510 --> 07:22.870
machine doesn't have a direct relationship with any hardware.

07:23.130 --> 07:29.760
I can move it from one physical server to another I can move it from one storage system to another.

07:29.760 --> 07:36.760
There's not this tight relationship between virtual machine and specific hardware.

07:36.770 --> 07:37.730
They're decoupled.

07:37.880 --> 07:42.680
And as we move a little bit deeper into the chorus We'll take a closer look at some of those mobility

07:42.680 --> 07:43.340
benefits.
