00:00.780 --> 00:07.200
In this video we'll introduce some of the concepts required to convert a physical machine to a VM.

00:07.680 --> 00:11.970
And there's a few different software options out there that can do this for you.

00:12.090 --> 00:14.900
I'll walk you through those in just a moment.

00:14.910 --> 00:18.920
They all work somewhat similarly though.

00:19.470 --> 00:22.830
So let's say we have this physical server.

00:22.980 --> 00:30.060
This is a physical server with let's say Windows installed on it and it's got all of this physical hardware

00:30.060 --> 00:34.320
like C-p use a network adapters and memory and data.

00:34.590 --> 00:41.690
And my Windows operating system has drivers for things like the network adapters.

00:41.690 --> 00:42.170
Right.

00:42.180 --> 00:49.350
It knows what kind of C-p use are these HMD or Intel seepages that's got a scuzzy controller to connect

00:49.350 --> 00:51.450
to these physical disks.

00:52.350 --> 00:56.120
And so there's stuff going on inside the operating system.

00:57.440 --> 01:00.680
That is aware of the actual physical hardware.

01:02.010 --> 01:09.220
So when we take this physical server and we use one of our tools to convert it to a virtual machine

01:10.500 --> 01:15.840
the first step that happens is the virtual machine is created.

01:16.050 --> 01:22.830
We're going to have a virtual machine present on one of our hypervisor is with the appropriate CPQ network

01:22.860 --> 01:27.970
memory and storage specifications.

01:28.230 --> 01:33.330
And it might not match up with exactly what we have in the physical server.

01:34.610 --> 01:46.600
As a matter of fact my VM may actually run better and faster if I give it fewer C.P. use when we create

01:46.600 --> 01:47.560
a virtual machine.

01:47.560 --> 01:52.250
Our goal is always to right size that virtual machine.

01:52.370 --> 01:57.800
It's never just take what the physical server had and duplicate it.

01:57.810 --> 02:03.420
Our goal is always the right size it to give the virtual machine the correct resources that it needs

02:03.690 --> 02:14.460
to do its job and nothing extra and we want our AVMA to be at about 60 70 percent utilization for CPQ

02:14.790 --> 02:16.170
and the same for memory.

02:16.200 --> 02:22.320
We don't want him sitting there at 10 percent Seip utilization with four Scipio's that's not good.

02:26.090 --> 02:31.850
We're also going to need a neck and a network interface card on the virtual machine.

02:31.850 --> 02:36.880
And this is going to be a hardware change for the guest operating system.

02:36.890 --> 02:43.580
So what we're going to now have is probably a network interface card that was specifically designed

02:43.640 --> 02:46.030
to run on a virtual machine.

02:46.100 --> 02:54.380
A good example of this is the VM where VM X net three virtual Nic the beautiful thing about this though

02:55.730 --> 03:04.730
is that now the virtual machine has no relationship with the actual physical hardware so we get mobility.

03:04.730 --> 03:11.750
But the other benefit that people don't think about so often is the fact that as I virtualise all of

03:11.750 --> 03:17.800
my windows instances and all of my Linux instances they're going to have a similar set of virtual hardware.

03:17.930 --> 03:22.330
It's going to really allow me to standardize my operating system configuration

03:24.760 --> 03:33.280
so what we place our physical hardware with virtual hardware and we'll replace our hard disk with a

03:33.280 --> 03:35.660
virtual disk.

03:35.690 --> 03:38.970
This is a file that could be on local storage of the host.

03:39.040 --> 03:43.770
It could be on a Fiber Channel or ice Gussie's storage array could be on an NFL server.

03:44.150 --> 03:51.950
Doesn't really matter where what matters is that we create this virtual disk and that we migrate all

03:51.950 --> 04:00.960
of the data from the source virtual machine to that virtual desk and when the VM powers on it's got

04:00.960 --> 04:09.030
its new hardware it's got its new disk and it should just work.

04:09.060 --> 04:13.440
So that's how we actually convert a physical server to a virtual machine.

04:13.560 --> 04:20.010
And depending on which hypervisor you're using VM Where has the center converter.

04:20.490 --> 04:30.630
Microsoft has the VM converter and VM has a product called disk to HD and now VM is a third party to

04:30.630 --> 04:32.100
this process.

04:32.100 --> 04:37.980
But they offer a conversion utility that you can use for Hyper-V and the VM product line is really excellent

04:38.160 --> 04:40.530
if you're considering virtualizing.

04:40.530 --> 04:41.880
It's definitely worth a look.

04:41.880 --> 04:46.140
They provide some excellent tools.

04:46.300 --> 04:51.890
So now we can start using these solutions to take our existing physical servers convert them to CMS

04:52.180 --> 04:54.070
and run them on our hypervisor.
